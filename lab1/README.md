## Part 1: Intro to TensorFlow
TensorFlow is a software library extensively used in machine learning. Here we'll learn how computations are represented and how to define simple neural networks in TensorFlow. TensorFlow uses a high-level API called [Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras) that provides a powerful, intuitive framework for building and training deep learning models. In this section you will learn the basics of computations in TensorFlow, the Keras API, and TensorFlow's new imperative execution style enabled by [Eager](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/10/eager-execution-imperative-define-by.html).
